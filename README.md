# Lift-shift-application-workload
In this project, we are going to host and run the workload on AWS cloud for production. For this we are going to use lift & shift strategy.
--------
Scenario: 
We have a lot of application services running on physical/virtual machines, the workload in the datacenter. So there is so many servers running a varieties of services on our local datacenter.
We will need virtualization team for running virtualization platform, data center, operations team for datacenter related operations, work monitoring team and sys admin team of course.
--------
Problem: 
Managing all these services, servers and teams is complex.It becomes more complex if you want to scale up or scale down, which needs to be done very regularly.There's a huge cost for procuring all these resources and also regular maintenance cost.
Most of the processes in this will be manual. If you have a virtualization layer on top of it, it is possible to automate those things, but it's really difficult to do it and also to maintain it. And not to mention all these things are very time consuming.
--------
Solution: 
Solution to all this problem is to have a cloud computing setup, so instead of running our workload in our data center, we run it on a cloud computing platform that we don't pay for the upfront cost for procuring the resource we pay as we go.
